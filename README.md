## TypeSnake

TypeSnake is a statically-typed, functional programming language inspired by Python and TypeScript. It aims to bring the simplicity and readability of Python while providing the benefits of static typing and modern language features.

## Features

- **Static Typing**: TypeSnake uses a powerful type inference system, allowing you to mix dynamic and static code as needed.
- **Block Scope**: Variables in TypeSnake follow block scope rules, ensuring better control over variable lifetimes and preventing accidental name clashes.
- **Modern Syntax**: TypeSnake features a clean and expressive syntax inspired by Python, with additions like type annotations.
- **Functional Programming**: TypeSnake supports first-class functions, lambda expressions, and other functional programming concepts.
- **Exception Handling**: TypeSnake provides a familiar try/except syntax for handling exceptions.
